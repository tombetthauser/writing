# Safer as Subjects ✌️

I remember a lot of rain when I was little. Then I remember heat. Dry grass and oak trees. The sun. I remember thinking it would just keep getting hotter and hotter until all the water evaporated, the clouds disappeared, all the trees died and all the people shriveled up into mummies and died alone in their apartments with no air conditioners. We never had an air conditioner.

Then we moved to the desert. The real desert. And I learned that that kind of heat could be beautiful. Especially when all the trees and rain was gone. Just little rocks going on forever. I used to dream that somewhere out there in all the millions of different shaped rocks there must be one that was shaped like my face. Maybe a thousand feet beneath some mountain. Waiting for light to hit it some day in a million years. I never went looking for it though.

We stayed until my dad saind the mountains started talking to him and when the town started descending. Then we moved back up north. But things weren't like I remembered them.

We used to just say that places started getting sketchy. Neighborhoods, towns, cities. We didn't understand what it was that was happening. Not the kids but not the adults either. We didn't even understand that something really was happening at all. But eventually it became clear that it was happening everywhere and they had to figure out something else to call it. It's hard to say if it helped anything really.

We were always safer as subjects. They didn't used to teach us any one way of thinking. That wasn't my experience anyway. They just let us figure it out ourselves. Most of us naturally fell into some form of individualism, which practically just meant celebrity warship. There were a million different paths to success that were all equally impossible. The trick to all of them was that you had to achieve a celebrity status in whatever particular field.

Back then what being a celebrity was seemed more complex. But it just meant having an audience of viewers that outnumbered the person being viewed. Early on this created a fairly traditional hierarchy. Eventually though it became common for an individual to not only be viewers of multiple celebrities, but also act as celebrities themselves. Addidionally functional celebrities were not limited to individuals but were also very often objects. They were often called spectacles because of this. At the end of the day this all created a very stable ecosystem ov overlapping spectacle hub-and-spoke models.
