I remember a lot of rain when I was little. Then I remember heat. Dry grass and oak trees. The sun. I remember thinking it would just keep getting hotter and hotter until all the water evaporated, the clouds disappeared, all the trees died and all the people shriveled up into mummies and died alone in their apartments with no air conditioners. We never had an air conditioner.

Then we moved to the desert. The real desert. And I learned that that kind of planet could be beautiful. We stayed until the mountains started talking to my parents and the town started descending. Then we moved back up north.

We used to just say that places started getting sketchy. Neighborhoods, towns, cities. We didn't understand what it was that was happening. We didn't even understand that something really was happening at all. But eventually it became clear that it was just happening everywhere and they had to figure out something else to call it. It's hard to say if it helped anything.
