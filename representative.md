# Representative ðŸ’¿

The first words the representative responded with were "I am a Representative." It had been passing innertly through the solar system for longer than anyone reading the message had been alive, having inexplicably reduced its speed by several orders of magnitude after passing through the oort cloud, making it's presence as a non-natural phenomena immediately known. 

That was over a century before initial contact was finally established. The initial reaction, when the representative seemed briefly to be heading directly toward Earth, had caused enough panic and general insecurity to all but destroy the global economy and material supply chain network. 

There were innumerable mass starvation events, resource-driven regional conflicts and micro-regional blackouts which referred to individual towns and cities functionally disappearing by dropping out of all external communication and economic activity. This also coincided with their disappearance from the electrical grid and in most cases were associated with brief periods of anarchy followed by being abandoned by 95% of former residents. 

But infact no one had any concrete information on what was occuring in these blackout regions unless they were motivated to physically visit these areas, which occurred regularly when family members went in search of relatives etc. Goverments initially made some effort to assist these communities but quickly developed much more pressing concerns. Soon governments for the most part became self-contained organizations concerned with military protection of critical infrastructure and key academic and scientific institutions along with the communities operiating them. They still maintained performative governance over their traditional regional boundaries, but in reality everything outside their immediate security borders was not under any kind of control and could not be realistically monitored except for critical security trhreats.

After this initial disruption phase settled into an ecosystem defined by small veins of persistant civilization surrounded by vast intersticial swaths of blackout regions organized attempts at analysis and contact with the then unidentified object resumed. One benefit from the disruption phase was the increased international cooperation between the remnant governments and their supported institutional communities. Increasingly they were driven by their largeley scientific communities and the traditional governmental entities took on an increasingly service-oriented role. Additionally all security operations shared essentially the same set of general concerns in perrrenially keeping government borders secure from what were referred to as vagrant communities. 

With some regularity the vagrant communities would begin developing into more stable proto-civilizations with systems of agriculture and governance. Many of these were not threatening to government concerns but they were often coopted by more aggressive groups focused on raiding secure government zones for resources. Often these groups crossed traditional national borders and became the concern of more than one government security force, and so aided in the increasingly cohesive behavior of the disperate international goverments. The scientific institutions already had a well-established history of cooperative behavior and set an easy-to-follow precident for the subordiante military and beurocratic communities.

By the time a somewhat stable order was established the original reason for the disruption (the representative) were not commonly considered a top priority. The scientific communities were focused primarily on agricultural and energy-oriented concerns, and military groups had no reason to see the representative object as enough of a concrete threat to prioritize. Nevertheless the small number of scientific groups still concerned with the object eventually had the resources to resume attempts at contact and study.

Oddly, the response from the object was more-or-less immediate. Contact through traditional radio frequencies was attempted when the object first entered the solar system with no response whatsoever. It's material and even it's exact shape could not be identified. Indeed the only information they had on it was its speed, which even at it's reduced rate was approximately 2 million miles per hour. It's speed prior to passing the oort cloud was unknown except insofar as it was immeasurable, which was assumed to mean it was travelling much faster but for all anyone knew could have meant it was using a form of travel that could not be measured in terms of conventional distance and time. For all practical purposes it simply appeared. Regardless it was unilaterally agreed upon that a reasonable first step would be to repeat the initial attempts at contact verbatim to establish a controlled starting point fro resumed study, naive as they seemed in hindsight. Radio frequency prime number sequences were transitted and before the initial set had finished the response came, alarming the the few low-level researchers present and starting a brief firestorm and resumed microcosm of the original panic up the chain of command.
